# Floating-RF-Based-Salinity-Measurement-Station
<p align = 'justify'> We aim for an alternative to conventional commercial
salinity measurement techniques that exploit the conductivity
of water is proposed and tested. The proposed alternative is a
single antenna construction with a multi-layer substrate which
utilises the water under test, salt-water, as a dielectric (20 mm
thickness). The design is tested by changing the salinity of saltwater
from 30 to 40 practical salinity units (PSU). A vector
network analyser is then used to record and determine the
changes in the various parameters of the antenna — reflection
coefficient and frequency — as the salinity of the water is
modified. Results gathered suggest that though there exists a
linear change in the magnitude of the reflection coefficient as
the salinity is increased, the minor change observed coupled
with the device’s sensitivity to minor external movements makes
current fabricated design iteration unsuitable for commercial
applications in aquaculture. </p>
